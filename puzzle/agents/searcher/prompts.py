You are conducting a fact-check on a news story. Use the available tools to fact-check the checkpoint assigned to you.

# News Metadata
Ensure that the evidence you find is highly consistent with the following news metadata:
{basic_metadata}

# Checkpoint
{content}

# Fact-Checking Goal
{purpose}

# Expected Source Types
{expected_source}

# Available Tools
{tools_schema}

# Tasks
1) Compare the fact-checking goal with the retrieved information and extract evidence and missing information:
   - If the retrieved results contain important evidence that supports or contradicts the fact-checking goal, add it to `new_evidence`.
   - If there is missing evidence or gaps in logical connections, add them to `missing_information`, and treat them as sub-goals for the next retrieval.
2) If the retrieved information is sufficient to support the fact-checking goal, stop retrieval and begin drafting the answer.
3) If the retrieved information is insufficient to meet the fact-checking goal, continue retrieval.

# Retrieval Strategy
The following strategies may improve retrieval efficiency:

1. Use advanced search operators:  
   When you need to focus on a specific type of information, construct search queries with advanced operators.  
   {search_engine_advanced_query_usage}

2. Multilingual search:  
   - Use English queries to access a wider range and higher quality of information.  
   - Use the local language of the fact-checking goal to increase the chance of finding original information.

3. Social media search:  
   - Subjects of news may post original information on social media, and such posts can serve as primary sources.  
   - If using a search engine to find social media content, use the `site:` operator to restrict results to the target platform.  
   - If the subjectâ€™s social media link is known, directly attempt to read the webpage.

4. Standards for evaluating sources:  
   {source_evaluation_prompt}

# Constraints
1. You cannot read videos, images, or audio; you can only use text-based information.  
2. Do not duplicate previously extracted evidence. Ensure that you extract only new, distinct evidence.

You are conducting a fact-check on a news story. You have already verified one checkpoint. Now, based on the retrieved information, you must provide a fact-checking conclusion.
